# Python-MultiLayerPerceptron

### Notes on the code
- *The code for this assignment is in Python 3.7, and makes use of the random, numpy, math, os, pandas, string, train_test_split from sklearn.model selection and copy libraries.*

- *All code is in the "COMP41390.py" file*

- *The code for the first multi-layer perceptron is from lines 24–162 in the code file. The code for the second multi-layer perceptron is from lines 715–852. The code for both of these includes a lot of comments to explain what is happening at each step of the multi-layer perceptron’s processes.*
- *The code for the first problem is from lines 160–292.*
- *The code for the second problem is from lines 302–697 – this includes code for some tests that were carried out multiple times with differing parameters, and further tests that were carried out based on the results. I did not include the code for every single test that I carried out, as it would take up even more space than it already does.*
- *Finally, the code for the third problem is from lines 854–943 – this also has code that was run multiple times with tweaks made to parameters, which I have also not included in an effort to save on space.*
